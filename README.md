#Feedback
I think challenge is created considering testing basic knowledge which is great, it did not consume a lot of time to answer questions in challenge. I am using github for first time, I had to spend some time in understanding and creating script. Over all, I enjoyed this experience and love the idea of basically just testing basics through challenges. It makes a lot of sense.
